            <p>
                I am an Informatics major with a focus on gaming at Arizona State University. I’ve been playing games for as long as I can remember and as a consequence, have a hard time not turning anything I create into a game including this project which I will code the game itself for. My favorite series of all time is Zelda and have poured an unhealthy amount of time into the MMO genre.

                I’m an undergrad at Arizona State University majoring in Computer Science. My main interests are game, mobile and web development. I am the lead for the back-end development of this project. As a beginner in relational database systems and SQL as a whole, I am hoping to expand my knowledge significantly through Loot Plus.
